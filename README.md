"slingshotting yourself across the interwebs" - ☆☆☆☆☆ - John Doe on notRealYelp<em>!</em>

UnusualTaste is a (COMPLETELY FREE) Node.JS server to get a taste of everything the internet has to offer, all using a tiny module by Nate Friendly.
To view a website with UnusualTaste, go to https://unusualtaste.onrender.com/view/YOUR_URL.
Please note that Chrome blocks the code sometimes. It's pretty annoying, but it's not phishing (all code's open source here), so you can feel confident safely looking at this.
There are a few warnings you might get:
- This site contains phishing (you can just bypass this by clicking "Advanced" and then going to like "visit this site")
- Chrome blocked this site (I've only encountered this on /view/, just reload until it works)

One more thing. I'm hosting this for FREE with Render, and you're accessing it and its code... FOR FREE. I'm not responsible for any host downtime on Render's end, because (shocker) I'm not Render. Don't DDOS them, thanks.
